  Our project is an application for meetings and finding interesting places for recreation. When entering the program, you can choose one of two buttons. Sports recreation, or intellectual. If you choose sports, you can see the map with many free sports grounds, such as: football, basketball, tennis, training grounds, etc. Since there are many marks on the map, you can use the search to find only the ones you need. If you click, for example, on a basketball court, a small chat will appear. You can write there, for example: "18:00. I have a ball, there are two of us, whoever can come, players are needed." People, for example, who live nearby, can add this site to their favorites, and any SMS on it will come to them, so they will always be aware of what is happening on the site.
  On the intellectual side, there are spots where people gather to promote poetry, play acoustic music, various quest rooms, and more.
